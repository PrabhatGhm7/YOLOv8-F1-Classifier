# F1 Livery Detection


## 🚀 Overview
F1 Livery Detection is a machine learning-powered application that identifies Formula 1 cars based on their liveries. Upload an image of an F1 car, and the model will predict the team with a confidence score.

🔗 **Live Demo:** [F1 Livery Detection on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Prabhat17/F1-Livery-Detection)

## 🏎️ Features
- Upload an image of an F1 car and get instant predictions.
- Identifies F1 teams based on car liveries.
- Displays the predicted class along with a confidence score.
- Built using state-of-the-art deep learning models.

## 🛠️ Technologies UsedTech Stack:
 ✅ YOLOv8 for object detection
 ✅ Python & OpenCV for preprocessing
 ✅ Gradio & Hugging Face for deployment
 
## 📌 How to Use
1. Visit the [live demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Prabhat17/F1-Livery-Detection).
2. Upload an image of an F1 car.
3. The model predicts the team and displays a confidence score.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Improve model accuracy with a larger dataset.
- Support for historical F1 cars.
- Enhance UI with additional insights (e.g., driver names, season-specific liveries).
